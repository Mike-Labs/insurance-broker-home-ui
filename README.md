## Adding Functionality to Ionic Fab Button

For the title we have given it a slot start and padding at the start.

The logo is fixed at the center and given transform property to maintain it's position on any other device.

The ion-fab-button holds the avatar and a nice blue border.

The other buttons have secondary colors to represent the brand.
